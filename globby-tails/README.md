# Tidal tails around all globular clusters

* Start with 1 cluster: NGC 5897
* Define annulus of stars in center of cluster to build a model of the CMD (use XD?)
* Find new cluster stars using matched filtering after cleaning away foreground (parallaxes)
* Show proper motions of candidates stars in coordinate system aligned with orbit of cluster
