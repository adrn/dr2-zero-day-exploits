# Visualize the local velocity field

Field of streams: bin up the sky, color pixels by mean distance

This: bin in sky position and distance (parallax?), color pixel by mean *angle* of proper motions on sky, set pixel saturation by magnitude of mean proper motion, make a movie stepping in distance
