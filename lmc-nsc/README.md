# Find the nuclear star cluster / SMBH in the LMC

If the LMC is as massive as some say, it should have a SMBH (M33 has one!). Where is it? Was it ejected from the center of the LMC? Did it retain its NSC?

Identify clusters of young or blue stars and measure their relative proper motions w.r.t. bulk motion of LMC - are any flying out of the center of the LMC?
